# inventory_backend.py

This is a simple program to test the functionality of the inventory system without implementing any UI. This was first shown to the client, after approval I moved on to 
creating a UI and adding more functionality.

# inventory_first.py

This was the first program which took the functionality of the program (inventory_backend) and added some UI with tkinter.

# inventory_second.py

After showing inventory_first.py to the client suggestions were suggested and more features were added, this is implemented in this code.
