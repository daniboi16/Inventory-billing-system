# billing_backend.py

This is a simple program to test the functionality of the billing system without implementing any UI. This was first shown to the client, after approval I moved on to creating 
a UI and adding more functionality.

# billing_first.py

This was the first program which took the functionality of the program (billing_backend.py) and added some UI with tkinter.

# billing_second.py

After showing billing_first.py to the client suggestions were suggested and more features were added, this is implemented in this code.
