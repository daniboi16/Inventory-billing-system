# Inventory System

This system should be able to keep track of the inventory. There are mainly two types of inventories: dress and material. This code should keep track of both in two separate 
data bases and add new entries to the respective database according to userâ€™s input. 

# Billing System

This system should be running 24x7 to do sale. The customers name and phone number should be taken down and then all the items should be noted with the help of the database. 
Then the bill should be printed and the system should be ready for the next customer.
